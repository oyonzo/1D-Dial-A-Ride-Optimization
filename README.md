#2D-MULTI-DRIVER-DIAL-A-RIDE-OPTIMIZATION

Algorithms to optimize Dial-A-Ride operations with multiple drivers in a 2-Dimensional space.

newnewMain - this is what we have been using in the Summer of 2023 to test our algorithms.

Algorithms:
Earliest- requests sorted on earliest pickup time
MinF - requests sorted by Min F value
Latest - requests sorted by earliest drop off time (similar to activity selection)
MSBP - the furthest we got on our multi-driver segmented best path algorithm

Classes:
Graph
Driver
Request
