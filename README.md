# 1D-Dial-A-Ride-Optimization

Efficient routing algorithms that optimize service and minimize drivers across a 1D plane. Other features (rideshare, dynamic pickup times, busroutes) have also been accounted for. The 2D version has since been implemented in a Dial a Ride Website for the Vermont department of transportation.
